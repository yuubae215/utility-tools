## 💡 Design Concept

The Utility Tools Portal is built specifically to enhance your interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs):

- **File Binder** is designed to synthesize text from multiple files into direct LLM prompts. By maintaining folder structures and combining multiple files, it creates extremely efficient prompts that provide complete context to the LLM in a single input.

- **Prompt Generator** helps control the design and layout of LLM-generated outputs. Users can easily create sophisticated, visually appealing documents by selecting from templates and references. With Mermaid diagram integration, the tool enables the creation of documents that organize information visually, elementally, relationally, and chronologically.

## ✨ Features

- 💻 **No Installation Required**: All tools run directly in your browser
- 🌓 **Dark/Light Mode**: Eye-friendly interface for day and night
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- 🌐 **Offline Capable**: Most tools function without internet once loaded
- 🔄 **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations
- 🌈 **Accessibility**: Designed with accessibility in mind
- 🧠 **LLM Optimized**: Specifically designed to enhance LLM workflows
- 🔄 **Bi-directional Workflow**: Helps with both input (prompts) and output (design) phases of LLM usage
